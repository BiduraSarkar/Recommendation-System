# Recommendation-System
# Association Rule Learning
# Apriori Algorithm
# Support = transactions having product P / total transactions
# Confidence = transactions having product P and C / transactions having product P
# lift = confidence / support
# higher the lift more is the relationship between 2 objects
# ALGORITHM
# set the minimum support and confidence 
# chose subsets of the transaction dataset which have support higher than the minimum support considered
# chose rules within the subsets which have confidence higher than the minimum confidence
# find out the lift and arrange them in decreasing order.
